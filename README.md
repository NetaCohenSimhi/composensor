# Compost Monitoring System
This project automates composting by monitoring temperature, oxygen levels, and soil moisture, uploading data to ThingSpeak. Temperature guides compost phases, while low oxygen triggers an aeration motor, and low soil moisture activates a water tap. This system efficiently maintains optimal composting conditions.
