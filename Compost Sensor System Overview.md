### **Temperature Monitoring** ###
Temperature readings guide us in determining the phase of composting:
- Phase 1: 45°C
- Phase 2: 50-60°C
- Phase 3: Above 70°C

### **Oxygen Level Analysis**

Oxygen levels between 5% to 15% are ideal for bacterial development. If levels fall below 5%, an automated motor is activated to aerate the compost, allowing for even oxygen distribution.

*Disclaimer: We did not have an oxygen sensor, so we wrote a function that generates random oxygen levels between 0 and 20 percent.*

### **Humidity Control** ###
Efficient soil moisture management is crucial:
- <30% moisture inhibits bacterial activity, particularly problematic during hot, dry periods.
- >65% moisture leads to sluggish decomposition, foul odors, and nutrient leaching.
- For moisture levels <30%, a water tap is activated to boost moisture content.

By continuously monitoring these parameters, we ensure the compost environment remains conducive to efficient decomposition and nutrient recycling.
